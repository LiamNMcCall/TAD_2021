#What research question do you want to answer?
#How does the lexical similarity between the statements of GOP senators re mass-shootings compare to that of statements re different events?

#What are two possible answers?
#Either there is a higher degree of lexical similarity between mass shooting statements or the degree is consistent with that of other statements re different events (budget hearings, foreign policy sessions, etc).
  
#What are the documents of text data you will analyze?
#the documents will be individual statements (speeches or pullen from twitter/their press sec.) of GOP senators
  
  
  
#Give two examples of documents in the corpus that you expect will be high in similarity to each other? Two examples that are *low* in similarity?
#I expect two documents from the mass shooting corpus to display high levels of similarity due senators following a cut and dry "Playbook" for statements on mass shootings. I expect two documents from a budget hearing Congressional session to have low similarity since there is a schism between war-hawk GOP senators and the so-called deficit hawks.
